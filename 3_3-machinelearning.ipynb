    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab does not continue the healthcare-provider scenario. Instead, you will work with data from an [automobile dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile).\n",

    "In this lab, you will:\n",

    "- Encode ordinal categorical data\n",

    "\n",
    "## About this dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset consists of three types of entities: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The specification of an automobile in terms of various characteristics\n",
    "2. Its assigned insurance risk rating\n",
    "3. Its normalized losses in use compared to other cars\n",
    "\n",
    "The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the automobile is riskier than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol that's associated with its price. Then, if it's riskier (or less risky), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this process *symboling*. A value of *+3* indicates that the car is risky. A value of *-3* indicates that the car is probably safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all cars within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports or speciality, and others). It represents the average loss per car per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Several attributes in the database could be used as a *class* attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attribute information\n",
